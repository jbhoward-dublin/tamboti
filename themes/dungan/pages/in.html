                            <h3>Project</h3>
                            <p> Within the HRA project Thesaurus Linguae Sericae (<a href="http://tls.uni-hd.de/" target="_blank">http://tls.uni-hd.de/</a>) Digital Research Archive of Dungan Studies aims to provide easy
                                access to information on Dungan language and culture in the context
                                of Central Asian and East Asian studies.</p>
                            <p>This site is under construction and welcomes
                                contributions from users, both in the form of additional materials
                                and in the form of bibliographic references.</p>
                            <h3>The Dungan People and their Language</h3>
                            <p>The history of the Dungan language is a case which can contribute
                                valuable data and insights to any general theory of how languages
                                form and change over time. Dungan (Chin. Dōnggānyǔ 東干語, Rus.
                                dunganskij jazyk) is a Central Asian minority language known to its
                                speakers as Khuėjzŭ jüjan (Хуэйзў йүян, Chin. Huízú yǔyán 回族語言). It
                                was established as a minority nationality language in Soviet Central
                                Asia in the 1920s and 1930s, comprising several different Mandarin
                                Chinese dialects spoken by Huí 回 ("Chinese Muslims") in different
                                places in Northwest China. The predominantly illiterate Dungan
                                migrants had brought their speech with them to Central Asia when
                                they migrated there in the 19th century after abortive uprisings
                                against the Qīng dynasty. Today, it is spoken by Dungans in
                                Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
                            <p>The Dungan language has a number of significant features, especially
                                when considered within the history of Chinese (Sinitic).</p>
                            <p> The Dungan language has not been written with Chinese
                                characters for a period of well over 100 years. The medium
                                of writing has since the 1950s been the Cyrillic (i.e. "Russian") script — a stark contrast to the Chinese morpho-syllabic script. It
                                is thus a fascinating test-case in which one may study what happens
                                to a Chinese dialect when it is completely cut off from the written
                                tradition which continues to influence the development of all
                                dialects within the PRC.</p>
                            <p>A full-fledged literature written in Dungan emerged in the
                                1930s and 1940s.</p>
                            <p>The concept of Dungan as an independent language with a
                                written standard was created by Soviet scientists and authorities, a
                                language incorporating several distinct, non-contiguous Chinese
                                dialects. </p>
                            <p>The Dungans predominantly do not consider
                            themselves or their native language to be "Chinese". </p>
                            <p>The language is now definitely endangered in as a result of
                                ever-increasing Russian–Dungan bilingualism since the Second World
                                War. A major language shift in favour of Russian has been underway
                                for some time. </p>
                            <p>As Chinese influence is becoming more
                                important in the Central Asian Region, there are signs that Dungan
                                is being redefined from the outside as a Northwestern Mandarin
                                Chinese dialect, a reappropriation, so to speak, of Dungan as a
                                Chinese dialect.</p>

                            <p>The Digital Research Archive of Dungan Studies is led by Christoph Harbsmeier and Ivo Spira.</p>
                            <p>The project is an outcome of a delegation to Central Asia organized by the University of Oslo and financed by the Royal Norwegian Department of Foreign Affairs in 2009. It is being conducted in close cooperation with a related project organized by the Centre of East Asian Linguistics (CRLAO) at the Centre Nationale de Recherche Scientifique in Paris under the leadership of Dr. Redouane Djamouri and Professor Alain Peyraube.</p>
