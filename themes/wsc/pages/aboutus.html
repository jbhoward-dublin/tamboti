    <p>The research project "Wissenschaftssprache Chinesisch / Modern Chinese Scientific
                                Terminologies - The Distribution of Western Knowledge in Late
                                Imperial China" is an international effort to understand the
                                translation of Western sciences and philosophies into China through
                                the reconstruction of Chinese terminologies coined since the early
                                nineteenth century. </p>
    <p>The WSC project has been supported by the Volkswagen Foundation since December
                                1996. It was started simultaneously at the East Asian Department of
                                the University of Göttingen and the Study Group for the History and
                                Philosophy of Chinese Science and Technology at Technische
                                Universität Berlin. It was continued at the Department of Middle
                                Eastern and Far Eastern Languages and Cultures at the
                                Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nürnberg in October 2000. </p>
    <p>Since February 2010, it is located at the Cluster of Excellence "Asia and Europe"
                                at Heidelberg University, where the data is being revised and
                                enlarged, external resources are integrated, and a more definitive
                                structure for the portal as well as a user-friendly interface are
                                being designed. A second stage will be devoted to consolidating data
                                gathered at Heidelberg and in cooperation with international
                                partners, refining the tools of analysis, and adapting solutions
                                developed here to the purposes and needs of other projects,
                                throughout the Cluster and beyond. Researches associated with the
                                WSC Project are based in Heidelberg, Frankfurt, Erlangen, Göttingen,
                                Shanghai, Peking, Paris, Oslo, Winnersh (UK), Osaka, Rome, Leuven,

    <p>As Jorge Luis Borges remarked, every dictionary is based on the obviously
                                unwarranted hypothesis that languages are made up of equivalent
                                synonyms. From a pragmatic point of view this hypothesis is
                                certainly indispensable. Yet, everyone who ever had to translate
                                seemingly unproblematic texts or propositions into a foreign tongue
                                has experienced that different languages consist only to a very
                                limited extent of equivalents. Even within Europe, with its many
                                shared cultural and linguistic roots, the incongruencies between the
                                terms of the different national and regional languages represent a
                                persistent nuisance for the translator. In the case of two systems
                                of speech and writing as different as the European and the Chinese,
                                the difficulties of translation and the limits of translatability
                                inevitably become even more obvious. At times, they may seem nearly
                                insurmountable.</p>
    <p>In view of this situation, the attempt, undertaken since the mid-nineteenth
                                century, to translate entirely foreign systems of knowledge--the
                                Western sciences and their underlying philosophical premises--into
                                the Chinese cultural and linguistic context must be viewed as a
                                truly challenging enterprise. In contrast to the historical,
                                political, sociological and intellectual aspects of China's
                                encounter with the modern West, this enterprise has up to now not
                                been sufficiently studied. Except for the works of Novotná
                                (1967-69), Ivanov (1973), Lippert (1979), Masini (1993), Xiong
                                (1994), Shen (1994) and Liu (1996), a number of essays investigating
                                the evolution of particular terms and some fruitful explorations
                                into the political language of the Chinese revolution, which have
                                each examined individual aspects of the problematic, no systematic
                                study has been undertaken, neither in Chinese or Japanese nor in any
                                Western language. The WSC Project is intended as a step towards
                                systematically reconstructing the formation and development of the
                                terms in which scientific discourse is articulated in the Chinese
                                speaking worlds today.</p>
    <p>The WSC Project aims to understand the translation of Western sciences and
                                philosophies into China through the reconstruction of Chinese
                                scientific terminologies coined, altered, disputed and successively
                                refined since the early nineteenth century. Due to the vast amount
                                of relevant sources, the project will limit its scope for the time
                                being to the disciplines of philosophy, logic, physics, chemistry,
                                geography (i.e. "knowledge on foreign countries"), politics and
                                international law. In addition, it will concentrate on the formative
                                period of modern Chinese scientific vocabulary between ca. 1840 and
                                1930. Although there were scattered efforts to translate "Western
                                learning", as it was known at the time, into Chinese languages by
                                Protestant missionaries in the first decades of the nineteenth
                                century, it was only in the aftermath of China's violent opening
                                during the so called "Opium Wars" of 1839-42 and 1860 that the terms
                                of the Western sciences began to find their way into Chinese learned
                                discourse. For obvious reasons, Chinese scholar-officials were at
                                first almost exclusively interested in knowledge they considered as
                                being useful for the defence of the Qing empire against further
                                foreign aggression: besides geographical knowledge on the nations
                                that so powerfully demonstrated China's vulnerability, the scholarly
                                elite initially decided to import above all such knowledge and
                                "cunning clues" that promised to cure the empire's apparent military
                                and economic weaknesses. The "Unequal Treaties" forced upon China by
                                various Western powers then also incited increased interest in the
                                pratice and intellectual tenets of international law. Eventually,
                                areas of Western learning that seemed to possess the potential to
                                upset the foundations of the traditional Chinese state came into
                                view around the turn of the century: promoted by a small, but
                                constantly growing number of reform-minded literati, political,
                                social and, finally, philosophical theories were introduced into the
                                reeling empire, now mainly through Japan, China's once despised
                                neighbour in the east that seemed to have mastered the challenge of
                                Western imperialism so much better than the intellectually
                                self-sufficient Middle Kingdom.</p>
    <p>The terms that were needed to translate the new ideas from various fields of
                                Western learning into Chinese discourse were coined in a process
                                that relied from the onset to a great extent on intercultural
                                cooperation. In addition to Chinese literati, Japanese scholars and
                                Protestant missionaries from many Western countries were involved in
                                the invention of the new lexicon. No matter if working on their own
                                or in groups, all translators had to overcome enormous difficulties.
                                In contrast to translations between European languages where
                                translators searching an appropriate rendering could turn to Greek
                                or Latin prototypes, the Chinese language did not share a conceptual
                                reservoir with the Indo-European languages wherefrom new terms could
                                be inferred. Neither existed a tradition of translation comparable
                                to European experiences that may have provided suitable models for
                                the interlingual transfer of hitherto unknown ideas. Finally, the
                                unique characteristics of the Chinese language and in particular its
                                script proved to be an obstacle that more often than not turned the
                                naturalization of foreign concepts into a choice between aesthetic
                                and semantic inadequacy. In view of all these difficulties, it is no
                                doubt a remarkable achievement that translators eventually succeeded
                                in inventing thousands of largely adequate terms for the flood of
                                new ideas streaming into China in the course of its confrontation
                                with the modern West.</p>
    <p>The reconstruction of the scientific terminologies that have evolved from this
                                complex process of translation, appropriation and intellectual
                                naturalization must rely on the systematic examination of extensive
                                source materials. Besides contemporary dictionaries and
                                encyclopedias, the WSC Project takes into account selected
                                monographs and translations of works on individual scientific
                                disciplines or topics, textbooks, introductory articles in learned
                                journals and the evolving press as well as essays, travel reports,
                                diaries and personal memoirs written by Chinese diplomats, scholars
                                and students. Following the compilation of a bibliographical
                                database on the transmission of Western learning into China, that by
                                now contains more than 8.500 relevant titles (monographs and
                                articles), we have established a preliminary sample of new Chinese
                                scientific terms on the basis of specialized and general
                                dictionaries published between 1815 and 1916. This terminological
                                sample currently includes entries on approx. 125.000 simple and
                                compound terms. At the moment, the sample data is being
                                cross-checked with lists of Western terms compiled from contemporary
                                specialized dictionaries of European languages in order to assess to
                                which extent it represents a full or biased picture of the
                                scienctific disciplines that were to be translated. Simultaneously,
                                we have begun to analyze a considerable number of primary texts,
                                beginning with the earliest or arguably most influential works in
                                each field.</p>
