    <h4>Search syntax</h4>
    <p>In Tamboti, when one searches for a specific term, only matches with the full term are
        retrieved, that is, a search for "Chin" does not retrieve all words beginning with "Chin"
        ("China", "Chinese" …), but only "Chin".</p>
    <p>One can use <em>wildcards</em> to perform broader searches. "?" can be used for a single
        character and "*" for zero, one or more characters: "China" is thus found with "Ch?na" and
        "C*a", and "China" and "Chine" are found with "Chin?", just as "China", "Chine" and
        "Chinese" are found with "Chin?". Note that "*" and "?" (unfortunately) cannot occur in the
        beginning of a word.</p>
    <p>
        <em>Fuzzy searches</em> can be performed by putting "~" at the end of a word, make it
        possible to retrieve "Chine" through "China~". One can quantify the fuzziness, by appending
        a number between 0.0 and 1.0, "complete fuzziness" (finding everything) being 0.0 and
        complete identity being "1.0". If you append a "~" with no number, you use the value 0.5.
        (Note that the actual value "1.0" is illegal: use "0.999…" instead.)</p>
    <p>
        <em>Phrases </em>can be searched for by putting them in quotation marks. Use "straight"
        double quotation marks only, that is, not single quotations marks or double quotation marks
        that are curly.</p>
    <p>If one searches for ""Popular Propaganda"", putting the two words in quotation marks, one
        will only find records in which the two words occurs in sequence, not if they occurs in the
        opposite sequence or at different points in the record.</p>
    <p>Note that Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters are indexed as separate words, so a search
        for "本日" (without quotation marks) will find records with the two characters in the opposite
        sequence, that is, with "日本" as well. However, if you enclose "日本" in quotation marks, you
        only retrieve records with the two characters in the specified sequence.</p>
    <p>The <em>boolean operators</em> "AND" and "OR" can be used. If you search for "China AND
        Japan", you will find only records with both the words. If you search for "China OR Japan",
        you will find records in which either or both the two words occur. The first search will
        normally result in fewer records than the second search. "NOT" can also be used. If you
        search for "China NOT Japan", you will only find records that have "China" but not "Japan".
        This search would also normally result in fewer records.</p>
    <p>One can make even more complicated searches by using parentheses: "(China OR Japan) NOT
        Korea" will thus find records in which the words "China" or "Japan" occur, but only those in
        which "Korea" does not occur.</p>
    <p>One can write "AND", "OR" and "NOT" in lowercase letters. In fact, searches are made in
        lower-case letters only, so writing "China" with initial lower-case "C" has the exact same
        effect as using an initial upper-case "C". As you will have figured out, you can spare
        yourself the effort of using upper-case letters and write all your search instructions in
        lower-case letters only.</p>
    <p>Note that since "and", "or" and "not" are reserved for making boolean searches, it is
        difficult to search for "hardship" in German (Not), "gold" in French (or) - and "duck" in
        Danish (and)! If you need to search for these three strings of letters, you will have to
        enclose them in quotation marks and include other search terms as well.</p>
