        <para> The motto for Tamboti is flexibility - flexibility both in matters of metadata
            description and in matters of control over who can access one's records. One should not
            be needlessly restricted in what one can describe by an over-simplified input schema and
            one should not forced to share one's input unless one chooses to do so. </para>
        <para> In order to provide a framework that allows many users to work on the database at the
            same time, a flexible user system has been introduced. This allows users to keep records
            private, to share records with one or more persons or groups of their own choice, and to
            give access to their records to everybody. </para>
        <para> In order to make it possible for users to enter standard records as well as more elaborate ones,
            a number of templates for common input tasks have been made. More of these can be furnished, if needed, 
            also for specific project needs.
            The user is not constrained to these input templates, but has the option of recording individual items in great detail, 
            with all the options provided by a regular library catalogue.
        </para>
        <para> Such flexibility comes at a price, for it obviously requires one to make choices,
            choices that in some circumstances may seem cumbersome. A lot can still be done to only
            display this complexity when the user requires it: in the present version, we recognise that
            the interface is rather complex in places, but we are working to improve this situation. </para>
