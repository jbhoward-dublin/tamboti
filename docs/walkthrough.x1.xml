        <para>
            Tamboti supports the use of wildcards. 
            "?" can be used for a single character and "*" for zero, one or more characters: "Japan" and "Japon" are thus found with "Jap?n" and "Chinese" and "China" are found with "Chin*". 
            You cannot use "*" and "?" in the beginning of a word.
        </para>
        <para>
            Fuzzy searches are performed by putting a tilde ("~") at the end of a search term, 
            making it possible to retrieve "Wegner" through "Wagner~". 
            One can quantify the fuzziness, by appending a number between 0.0 (totally fuzzy) and 0.9 (little fuzziness). 
            The default is 0.5.
        </para>
        <para>One can perform boolean searches (searches involving "and", "or", and "not"), by using Advanced Search, 
            but this is also possible in Simple Search.</para>
        <para>One can use "AND" and "OR" between terms. 
            If one searches for "China AND Japan", one will retrieve all records which contain both these terms, 
            and if one searches for "China OR Japan", one will find all records in which one or both of these term occur. 
            "NOT" can also be used: "China NOT Japan" retrieves records in which "China" occurs, 
            but "Japan" does not occur. 
            Note that these operators have to be written in upper-case.
        </para>
        <para>
            Operators can be grouped with parentheses, as in "(China OR Japan) NOT modern". One can also combine boolean operators with wildcard searches and fuzzy searches. </para>
        <para>
            Phrases can be searched for by putting them in quotation marks. 
            If one searches for "Modern China" (with quotation marks) one will find all records in which this precise string occurs, 
            whereas if one searches for "Modern China" (without quotation marks), 
            one will find all records in which the two words "China" and "Modern" occur, in any order.
