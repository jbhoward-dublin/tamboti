        <para>The Tamboti metadata records follow the <ulink url="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/" target="_blank">MODS</ulink> standard for bibliographical
            description curated by the US Library of Congress. "MODS" is short for "Metadata Object Description Schema." </para>
        <para>This standard allows one to catalogue many different kinds of material, not just
            books and articles, but also web sites, photos, videos, maps, computer files and so on.
            It allows one to catalogue in great detail, but also to catalogue in a simple manner. It
            allows one to relate one record (say, an entry for a book) to another entry (say an
            entry for a movie) and it allows one to make notes that one can "type" freely. </para>
        <para>You don't have to make acquaintance with this format in order to use Tamboti, but basically all it does is to surround each type of information with a set of tags,
            like &lt;title&gt;A Midsummer Night's Dream&lt;/title&gt;. 
            The tags tell, more or less clearly, what is inside them, in this case a title. 
            The complications come from the fact that tags can "nest" inside other tags, creating hierachies of content.
        </para>
        <para>The MODS format is a "sister" of the MARC format used by most larger libraries, national as well as university. 
            MODS is widely used as an exchange format and when resources from different libraries are
            aggregated. An good example of a large-scale aggregation project using MODS is <ulink url="http://www.americanhistoryonline.org/" target="_blank">American History
                Online</ulink>. MODS-using sites similar to Tamboti are 
            <ulink url="http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Columbia University Academic Commons</ulink>
            and
            <ulink url="http://cdi.uvm.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Vermont Libraries' Center for Digital Initiatives</ulink>.</para>
        <para>MODS is presently used as a cataloguing format primarily for "untraditional" library resources, 
            such as images and web pages, but is slowly gaining ground as a format for traditional library resources as well. 
            MARC records can be converted, almost losslessly, to and from MODS records.</para>
