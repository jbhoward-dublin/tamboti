        <para> When you access Tamboti without logging in, you are able to search in material that
            is open to everybody, to all "guests." </para>
        <para>When you have logged in, you can additionally search in material that is open to you
            alone, in material that is shared with you, and in material that is open to groups to
            which you belong.</para>
        <para>Even after you have logged log in, you will not see all material in the database,
            since it is likely that there are other users who keep at least some of their records
            private to themselves.</para>
        <para>The material that you wish to keep to yourself cannot be seen by anybody else, unless
            you choose to allow this. Below, it will be explained how you go about sharing your
            material, should you choose to do so.</para>
        <para>When searches are performed, only material open to a certain user is retrieved: the
            rest of the database could just as well not have existed. Needless to say, the parts
            that outsiders cannot see cannot be edited by them. </para>
        <para>Though, generally speaking, it is hard to imagine why one would not want to share
            one's finished bibliographical records with everybody, a project might wish to develop a
            bibliography, keeping the draft visible to a certain group and editable to another
            group, before a decision has been made to publish it to the world at large. In other
            frameworks where we will apply the same user model, the benefits of this flexibility
            will be more evident.</para>
